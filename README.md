# BaseBot_Obstacle_Course
# Course description and obstacle details. 
- Our course had 5 obstacle courses, each interacting with our basebot (Hannah). Our course goes in a zig zag line on a 4x3 tile floor. Our first obstacle was a ramp where we set our basebot on. The second obstacle was a bumpy terrian. Our third obstacle had shapes (more specifically cubes) that Hannah had to avoid. Our fourth obstacle was just a simple bridge/ramp for him to go on. And the last obstacle was a cube that Hannah had to drag down all the wall to the wall to knock is over, which then gets ran over by him. And that is the end of our course. 
# How your BaseBot interacts with each obstacle. 
- For the first onstacle course, Hannah interacts with it by going down the ramp which gives him acceleration for the second obstacle which he just has to go through. It does challenge our basebot a bit becasue of the bumpy terrian instead of the smooth, flat one. Once he gets through all that he turns to the shapes that he has to avoid in order to get past becasue if he does bump into one of the obstacles, it would hinder movement. Once he gets through those all he does is go over the speed bump which was the fourth obstacle. The last obstacle is where he interacts with the most. He interacts with it by holding and dragging a cube to the end which is a wall that he runs over with help from the cube. He runs over that wall and he finishes the obstacle course! Ta-da!!!

# Reflection on what worked well and what challenges you faced. 
- What he worked well on was most of the basebot, and the obstacle course. He handlded those pretty quickly and sufficiently. We also worked well on most of our github repository, although there were a couple complications due to our work not saving. The things that we had a little trouble on was one what I talked about earlier, the complications on our repository since a big, important chunk of our work deleted. But we handled that well for the most part. We also had a little teeny-tiny amount of trouble on our basebot since we did some work wrong and had to re-do it a couple times. We also struggled a bit with communication since one of our team members are never here and they had no clue on what we were doing, but we figured things out at the end and they ended up doing a decent amount of work. But other than that a just a little amount of stress, we got our assignemnt done so YIPPEE!!!
